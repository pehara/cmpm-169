			<h1>Experiment 6 - Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p> I started by first choosing a design from the available examples that I liked and studying its code. Understanding the structure, variables, and functions used in the design was my primary goal at first. Which then allowed me to make the necessary changes to the code to get it functioning and to finally create something of my own. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> I Changed the colours and added a smooth transition between background colours to improve the design. Followed by adding a font toggle feature to allow users to swap between fonts I then added particle effects to the text to improve visual appeal and originality. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> I played with various particle effects, altering properties like lifespan, density, and color before finally finding a look I liked. I looked at several ways to further modify the design, such as adding interactive elements or dynamic animations, however, a lot of my ideas were out of scope. In the end, I settled on the particle effects and made sure they were specialized to my design. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on all the different elements of the project, including analyzing the original code, making improvements, and documenting the process.</li>
					<li>In retrospect, I thought the imitation phase to be the most uncomplicated step because it gave a clear starting point. Adding the additional features involved a lot more testing and debugging, but it was satisfying to watch the design progress evolve. The innovation phase was the most difficult but also the most fascinating because it drove me to think creatively and investigate new options, I originally was attempting to have a different design but by playing around with the code I found an outcome that was much more appealing in my opinion.					</li>
					<li>My highs include effectively incorporating new features and seeing the design come to life. Finding creative methods to improve my project. However, my low points include dealing with problems and unexpected obstacles during the integration and innovation phases. Where I was struggling to find the correct blend between originality and usability. </li>
				</ul>
