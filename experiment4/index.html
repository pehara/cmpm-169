			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p> Before, I used a lot of the examples provided to us for my experiments. So, I wanted to try something new and find a different piece of art to base my experiments on. I decided to focus on a pixel art style by andyhaskell. I then incorporated my own elements by adding my cat as the main subject. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> I added a tool that lets you change the size of dots on the fly by using a global variable to keep track of changes in dot size. I also added shape options at this point in development, I was able to add squares, hearts & triangles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> Finally, in my last stage I implemented a save feature using the S key, whcih also led me to implement a upload function using the I key. I also added a zoom function that lets you to make the pixels bigger and smaller by using the z and x keys.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For this assignment I was able to work on everything on my own. I took initiative in all my design elements that I decided to create, I really wanted to be able to make something I could be proud of and was a creative piece of work that also achieved the directions given for the experiment. While I did work alone, I did still encounter some highs and lows. My high of the experiment was adding a feature that allows me to increase and decrease the size of the dots using the arrow keys. But my low was trying to make the image dynamically adjust its size based on how big the screen was, I ended up not implementing it because it was not incredibly urgent. So to conclude, I felt that this experiment was very educational and taught me a lot more since I have never worked with images before.</li>
				</ul>
