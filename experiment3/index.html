			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Design with Circles</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>During this first phase, I imitated an existing design (P_2_1_2_03) by switching from squares to circles. This required understanding the monochromatic color scheme and dynamic movement dependent on the cursor position from the original design, which would help me later on. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>During the integration stage, I used the map function to provide colour variations, which improved the background dynamics of the design. The smooth transition from squares to circles offered simplicity and versatility in selecting a single circle colour, however, I did experiment with different shapes earlier on. I contemplated later adding a feature to change the shapes but decided not to. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> During the invention phase, I added the ability to change the canvas dynamically, concealed the cursor in order to have a cleaner interface, and reversed colour elements to create variations that were more visually appealing. I mainly did that so that the circles and the background were more distinct. Also, the decision to make circles smaller and filled in, was influenced by comic book graphic gradients, because I always found them interesting and very appealing to look at. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reflecting on this assignment, I was the main contributor to the overall design and interactivity of the experiment. I based it off the original reference that I found and then I tried to create my own variant of the design.  I added features that created color variations and changed the shape to a circle. For this experiment I did not collaborate with any other students in this class. But I found the color addition the high of this experiment and also the most rewarding because it made it more visually aesthetic. However, I did face challenges initially when I tried to figure out what shape I wanted to do, I originally was going to follow the star theme but it had a weird look to it that I was not fond of. Overall, I found this experiment very rewarding and felt that it taught me a lot more about the capabilities of generative design.
